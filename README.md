In essence, we need to recreate a Passenger Flight Risk system, with views for being able to view passengers sorted by risk, along with their personal details, and details of flights that they may be travelling on.  There is also a requirement for the customer to be able to edit details on passengers, risks or flights. A map functionality was also discussed as a stretch goal for the system.
